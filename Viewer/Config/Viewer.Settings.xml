      The Geocortex Viewer for Silverlight can retrieve viewer configurations 
      from your Geocortex Essentials REST Elements installation and include 
      them in the list displayed on the launch page. To enable this feature:
      
      1. Uncomment the RemoteSettings element below and change "localhost" to 
         the name of the machine that hosts your Essentials installation.
         
      2. If you installed a named instance of Essentials, insert 
         "<INSTANCE_NAME>/" after "Essentials/" in the URI.
      
      3. If you did not install Essentials in the default virtual directory, 
         change the "/Geocortex/Essentials/REST" portion of the URI to the 
         virtual directory, in which your Essentials installation is located.
      
      If you want to retrieve all of your viewer configurations from your 
      Essentials installation (i.e. you're planning to remove all of the 
      ViewerConfig elements from the list below) and you want to be able to
      access the launch page, please note that commenting out or removing the
      ViewerConfig element with Id "Launch" will remove the launch page.
